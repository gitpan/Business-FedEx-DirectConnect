Business/FedEx/DirectConnect version 0.01
=========================================
This module is an alternative to using the FedEx Ship Manager API.  
Business::FedEx::DirectConnect will provide the necessary communication using LWP and 
Crypt::SSLeay.
The main advantage is you will no longer need to install the JRE dependant API 
provided by FedEx.  Instead, data is POST(ed) directly to the FedEx transaction servers.
Additionally, Business::FedEx::DirectConnect allows full "non-Win32" functionality. In the 
previous version, non-windows users had to proxy to a windows box.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
